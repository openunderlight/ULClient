Your character would have no way of knowing sports scores or the latest in music or fashion.

There are two basic types of quests: Talisman quests and Codex quests. For Talisman quests, after you press 'Post' you will be presented with another screen  where you can specify the type of item to be retrieved. For Codex quests, you will be presented with another screen where you may enter keywords that must be in the codex to satisfy the quest. A dreamer who accepts a quest and returns to the quest posting board with the proper talisman or codex will receive the XP award for the quest. \n\nEach day you receive a pool of 5000 XP for posting quests. The XP award for the quest multiplied by the number of recipients must be less than your remaining QuestXP pool. The minimum number of recipients is 5.\n"

Note that you can not edit a quest after it has been posted, to prevent a situation where a dreamer might unknowingly complete an earlier version of the quest. Also, the number of charges you specify will be treated as the minimum number of charges the item must have to satisfy the quest.\n\nWhen you mark a quest as completed, dreamers who have accepted it can still finish the quest and receive their reward, but no new dreamers can accept it. And it's always a good idea to describe either the talisman to be retrieved or the codex keywords in the main message for the quest, because only the summary, message, suggested stat, and suggested sphere will be displayed in the dreamer's goalbook, as dreamers need to go back to the quest posting boards to view the quest details."

Roleplay Points (RPs) are a system in Underlight to reward excellent play where there is not already a game mechanism in place to do so (such as XP or item acquisition).  \n\nBecause Underlight is driven by players interaction, RPs are an important way to encourage roleplay, creativity, and enthusiasm. This ensures that players who focus on roleplay, develop strong personalities, and generally make the game fun for everyone are rewarded for their efforts."
    IDS_PPOINT_HELP2        "How are Roleplay Points gained? Characters only gain RPs when other give them a RP using the ""Grant RP"" button on the control panel. Each character has a ""pool"" of RPs he may grant to others each day; when given away, the RPs in this pool are automatically refreshed every 24 hours. Characters do not lose anything for granting RPs out of their pool (RPs in your pool can only be granted, and never used by you.). Each time a RP is granted, the granting character must provide a short description of what was done to earn the RP. To prevent favoritism, each character may only grant one RP to any other character once per 7 days."
    IDS_PPOINT_HELP3        "What can I do with Roleplay Points? Characteres may use RPs to advance their charaters in ways not normally possible - including permanent stat increases, bypassing Train requirements, and evoking Arts the character can not normally cast! RPs allow an entirely new path of advancement beyond gaining XP and advancing in House rank. This allows characters who focus on roleplay, social interaction, and developing their personality to become more powerful through the acquisition and use of RPs. To use RPs, use the 'Use RP' button on the bottom left of the control panel. \n\n"
    IDS_PPOINT_HELP4        "When should I grant a Roleplay Point via Reward? Whenever a character does anything that is especially cool or that otherwise makes the game more fun! Good examples include: excellent roleplay; organizing an event; being helpful; being creative, enthusiastic, passionate, and/or original; and doing something purely because it fits the character's personality and beliefs, especially when doing so is disadvantageous for the character! In short, use Reward anytime another player should be thanked for making the game more fun for you. Lastly, because RP grants are, like XP, out of character, players are encouraged to grant RPs to friends and foes alike...after all, a great hero can not exist without a great villain to oppose him!"
